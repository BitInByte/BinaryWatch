## Intro
Basic project made in hollidays without internet. This project was a challenge to myself to perform a small product without using the internet to search for something.   
### Installing
  
The project can be cloned and there's two steps to test the project and can be tested by yourself, with all of the changes that you want to do!  
  
Step 1: Run the next script to create a live local server and build in dev mode in real time  

```
npm run start  
```
  
Step 2: Buil the project to be ready for production

```
npm run build:css  
```
  
The commands above need to be introduced on the root folder of the project.
